# Storage Model

`DataKey` is defined in [`src/types.rs`](../src/types.rs). All I/O goes through
[`src/storage.rs`](../src/storage.rs).

| Key | Storage | Value | Bound |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Initialized` | instance | `bool` | 1 |
| `AdminList` | instance | `Vec<Address>` | `MAX_ADMINS` = 10 |
| `Template(u32)` | persistent | `Template` | `MAX_TEMPLATES` = 256 |
| `TemplateList` | persistent | `Vec<u32>` | `MAX_TEMPLATES` = 256 |
| `FolderOwner(String)` | persistent | `Address` | one per owner |
| `OwnerFolder(Address)` | persistent | `String` | one per owner |
| `UserTemplate(Address)` | persistent | `u32` | one per owner |
| `Portfolio(Address)` | persistent | `PortfolioNFT` | one per owner |

Instance storage is a single ledger entry that every invocation loads, so it holds only small,
bounded values. Templates used to live there and could have grown it without limit. They are now
in persistent storage.

## TTL policy

Constants are in [`src/constants.rs`](../src/constants.rs). One day is about 17,280 ledgers.

| Storage | Extended to | Re-extended when TTL drops below | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instance + code | 120 days | 90 days | Every state-changing call (`initialize`, admin, claim, template, mint, update) |
| Persistent | 120 days | 90 days | Every read or write of that entry |

- 120 days is below the testnet and mainnet `max_entry_ttl` of about 180 days (3,110,400
  ledgers), so the host never clamps the request. A test pins this.
- The 30-day gap between the two values means each entry pays for an extension at most about
  once a month.
- An entry that nobody touches for about 120 days is archived. It can be restored with
  `stellar contract restore`; it is not lost.
- Read-only calls that are only simulated, never submitted, don't persist extensions.
